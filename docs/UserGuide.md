## Introduction

Welcome to the User Guide (UG) of **SmartLib**!

Are you an owner of a private book loaning service or a library,
who is struggling to keep track of your readers' and books' records?
Do you frequently spend countless hours of your time trying to organize and manage the mountain of records generated by
your readers' borrowing activities?

If the above situation sounds familiar to you, fret not, for SmartLib is here to save the day!
SmartLib is a desktop application which would help you reduce the hassle of managing your business or library,
and save your valuable time.
It is an application optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI),
meaning that you will be operating the application by typing commands into a Command Box.
It also provides users with the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI),
which is a feature that enables users to interact with the application through simple interactive graphics such as buttons.

If you can type fast, SmartLib would be a brilliant and efficient assistant in the systematic management of your books
and borrowers' information, as compared to the traditional GUI apps currently available in the market!

If you are interested in using our wonderful application,
head over to [Quick start](#quick-start) now to learn how to begin your journey with SmartLib!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Quick start

1. Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.

2. Download the latest `smartlib.jar` from [here](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-W13-2/tp/releases).

3. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for your SmartLib.

4. Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI similar to the below should appear in a few seconds. Note how the app
   contains some sample data.<br>
   ![Ui](images/Ui.png)

5. Type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it. e.g. typing **`listbook`** and pressing Enter will
   list all the current books in store.<br>
   Some example commands you can try:

    * **`addreader`** `r/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01` : Adds a reader named
      `John Doe` to SmartLib.

    * **`deletereader`** `3` : Deletes the 3rd contact shown in the current list.

    * **`listbook`** : Lists all stored books in SmartLib.

    * **`exit`** : Exits the app.

6. Refer to the [Features](#features) below for details of each command.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `addreader r/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `addreader r/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `r/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `r/John Doe t/friend` or as `r/John Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/VIP`, `t/VIP t/MostFrequentCustomer` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `r/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER r/NAME` is also acceptable.

* If a parameter is expected only once in the command but you specified it multiple times, only the last occurrence of
  the parameter will be taken.<br>
  e.g. if you specify `p/12341234 p/56785678`, only `p/56785678` will be taken.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be
  ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* **Alphanumeric**: Alphanumeric characters include uppercase letters from 'A' to 'Z',
  lowercase letters from 'a' to 'z', and
  numbers from '0` to '9'.

* **Barcode**: A barcode is an unique identifier for a book. Books with the same name will share the same ISBN,
  but each copy of a book with have a different barcode. This is to ensure that you will not be having a headache
  when trying to keep track of which copy of a book has been returned and which copy hasn't.

* **Command Box**: The _Command Box_ is the component of the GUI where you will be entering your user input.

* **International Standard Book Number (ISBN)**: The ISBN is a numeric commercial book identifier which is intended to
  be unique for each book. Books with the same name will share the same ISBN. A 13-digit ISBN can be separated into
  its parts (prefix element, registration group, registrant, publication and check digit), and when this is done it is
  customary to separate the parts with hyphens or spaces.

* **Result Display**: The _Result Display_ is the component of the GUI where you will be notified whether your command
  was successfully executed by SmartLib.

* **Special characters**: Special characters refer to any characters that are not alphanumeric.
